should I create a separate display app?
Or add a display mode where editing capabilities won't be present?

For now the direction is a separate display mode.
For the next version, separating editing app and rendering app would be preferable?

TODO:
Problem:

Fix the dragging behavior when enlarging elements

should replace ColorPicker with ColorPicker2 in the elements editor
